- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zoe!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in legacy iPhones, Apple dualbooting, and legacy jailbreaking :)
- ðŸŒ± Succesfully downgraded my iPhone 6 from iOS 12.5.7 to iOS 11.4 with the help of MatthewPierson's Divise and Ramiel toools!
- âœ¨ Next project will likely be downgrading an iPhone 5S to iOS 10.3.3, hopefully!
