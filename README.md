- ðŸ‘€ iâ€™m interested in legacy iphones, cool tech stuff â„¢, attempting and failing to flash roms, old mobile tech, and legacy jailbreaking :)
- ðŸŒ± my first project was downgrading my iPhone 6 in September 2023 from iOS 12.5.7 to iOS 11.4 with the help of MatthewPierson's Divise and Ramiel tools! (later downgraded it to ios 8.3 using semaphorin)
